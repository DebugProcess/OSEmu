OSEmu
======

Here is a working sample for a simple (micro) emu.
It includes the basic needed cs357x (camd35 UDP) functionality, and is very simple and compact.


Build: 
======

- Put a SoftCam.Key file into the source code directory (for example from skystar.org).
  Note: This does not apply for Mac OSX and Android, SoftCam.Key cannot be integrated on these systems at the moment. 
  
- Run `make` to compile OSEmu.

  Info: If you want to cross-compile OSEmu search for the "simpleemu" script by gorgone.


Run:
====

- (optional) OSEmu does not require, but will make use of "SoftCam.Key" if available. 
             "SoftCam.Key" is searched in:
              - /var/keys
              - The folder specified with the "-c <folder>" option.
              

- You may use the program with the following options:

  -a <user>:<password> (set the cs357x user and password) [REQUIRED]
  -p <portnumber> (set the cs357x port) [REQUIRED]
  -c <folder> (set the folder where SoftCam.Key is searched)
  -b (start OSEmu in background/daemon mode)
  -v (log debug information)
  -l <logfile> (write logs to this file)
  -e (enable emm au) 
      - Viaccess3: Needs M0 key; oscam clients must be version r9843 or newer, and the OSEmu reader must have set "via_emm_global = 1".
      - Irdeto2: Needs M0 and M3/4/5/6 key

  Examples:
    /usr/bin/OSEmu -a user:password -p 11000 -b
    /usr/bin/OSEmu -a user:password -p 11000 -b -c /usr/keys -l /var/log/osemu.log -e
