OSEmu
======

Here is a working sample for a simple (micro) emu.
It includes the basic needed cs357x (camd35 UDP) functionality, and is very simple and compact.


Build: 
======

- Put a SoftCam.Key file into the source code directory (for example from skystar.org).
  Note: This does not apply for Mac OSX and Android, SoftCam.Key cannot be integrated on these systems at the moment. 
  
- Run `make` to compile OSEmu.

  Info: If you want to cross-compile OSEmu search for the "simpleemu" script by gorgone.


Run:
====

- (optional) OSEmu does not require, but will make use of "SoftCam.Key" if available. 
             "SoftCam.Key" is searched in:
              - /var/keys
              - The folder specified with the "-c <folder>" option.
              

- You may use the program with the following options:

  -a <user>:<password> (set the cs357x user and password) [REQUIRED]
  -p <portnumber> (set the cs357x port) [REQUIRED]
  -c <folder> (set the folder where SoftCam.Key is searched)
  -b (start OSEmu in background/daemon mode)
  -v (log debug information)
  -l <logfile> (write logs to this file)
  -e (enable emm au) 
      - Viaccess3: Needs M0 key; oscam clients must be version r9843 or newer, and the OSEmu reader must have set "via_emm_global = 1".
      - Irdeto2: Needs M0 and M3/4/5/6 key
  -L (only allow local connections from localhost)
  -i (show OSEmu version info and exit)
  
  Examples:
    /usr/bin/OSEmu -a user:password -p 11000 -b
    /usr/bin/OSEmu -a user:password -p 11000 -b -c /usr/keys -l /var/log/osemu.log -e


OSCam reader config for OSEmu
=============================

[reader]
label                         = OSEmu
protocol                      = cs357x
device                        = 127.0.0.1,11000
user                          = user
password                      = password
caid                          = 0D00,0D02,0D03,0D05,090F,0500,1801,0604,2600,FFFF
ident                         = 0D00:000000,000004,000010,000014,000020,0000C0,0000C4,0000CC;0D02:000000,00008C,0000A0,0000A4,0000A8;0D03:000000,000004,000008,000024,000028;0D05:000000,000004,000010;090F:000000;0500:000000,030B00,023800,021110,007400,007800;1801:000000,007301;0604:000000;2600:000000;FFFF:000000
group                         = 1
via_emm_global                = 1 


BISS/ConstCW config
===================

Syntax for keys in SoftCam.Key: (key number can be '00' or '01')
F <service id><ecm pid> <key number> <key>

Example:

	service id: 2222
	ecm pid: 1111
	key: 0102030405060708

	F 22221111 00 0102030405060708
	
Important:
	The correct ecm pid is only available when using oscam dvbapi.
	For example:
			oscam (dvbapi) <-> OSEmu
			oscam (dvbapi) <-> oscam <-> OSEmu
			
	When using another client like cccam, the ecm pid seen by OSEmu will always be '1FFF'
	For example:
			cccam <-> oscam <-> OSEmu
			cccam <-> OSEmu
	In this case the above example key line needs to be changed to:
	F 22221FFF 00 0102030405060708


	When using cccam clients for BISS/ConstCW create a second reader with no ident line:
	
[reader]
label                         = OSEmu-BISS
protocol                      = cs357x
device                        = 127.0.0.1,11000
user                          = user
password                      = password
caid                          = 2600,FFFF
group                         = 2
